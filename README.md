# DSA C++ Practice

This repository contains C++ implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, organized by topic. Each folder contains source code (`.cpp`) and compiled executables (`.exe`) for hands-on practice and learning.

## Folder Structure

- **Arrays/**
  - Problems related to arrays, such as finding the largest element, rotating arrays, removing duplicates, and more.
- **Basics & Recursion/**
  - Fundamental programming problems and recursion-based solutions, including Armstrong numbers, Fibonacci series, palindrome checks, and more.
- **Hashing/**
  - Hashing techniques and problems like frequency counting, character and number array hashing, and finding high/low frequency elements.
- **Searching Algos/**
  - Searching algorithms such as linear search.
- **Sorting Algos/**
  - Sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and their recursive versions.

## How to Use

1. **Compile a Source File**
   - Use the provided build tasks in VS Code or compile manually with MinGW:
     ```sh
     g++ <filename.cpp> -o <output.exe>
     ```
2. **Run an Executable**
   - Execute the compiled `.exe` file:
     ```sh
     ./<output.exe>
     ```


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in VS Code.
3. Explore the folders and try running or modifying the code to deepen your understanding of DSA concepts.
